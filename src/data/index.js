  "You were raised in a barn and have since forgotten to close every door you've walked through. A problem that was highlighted at the siege of Iron Gate Castle, where as the last one to take refuge you left the famous Iron Gate wide open for the besiegers.",
  'Your whole town was burned to the ground and you were forced to leave and make a living on the road. Typically there was nobody left to own up to about the fire.',
  'You studied your chosen combat techinque for years, becoming one of the greatest talents known in the land. Having slipped getting out the bath, you bumped your head and forgot everything. Easy come easy go.',
  "Your father on his deathbed gave you your exquisite family sword. Before he could give you his solemn speech you snatched it with a chuckle and went outside to swish it around. You haven't forgotten the look of sadness on his face, but you have forgotten where you put the sword.",
  "Your mother was a fighter in the resistance. Every day she fought for your freedom. For you to do as you choose. And now you choose to eat cereal without milk, and don't bother with deoderant. Life is pretty good.",
  "You've never amounted to much. You've never had any ambitions, never had any drive, you've never had any money. What you do have is a chicken, called Kevin.",
  "Your mother was accused of being a witch, which you've never forgiven yourself for.",
  'Your father was one of the great generals of this age. Valiant in combat, accurate in decision, apart from when you asked him to pull your finger atop that live volcano.',
  'You never knew who your parents were. The only people who cared for you called themselves mom and dad. They were kind enough, but one morning without a word you set off to find them.',
  "Your brothers were cruel. They'd call you useless, a waste of space, a fool. In later years you came to realise they loved you, and were only preparing you for the things you'd hear for the rest of your life.",
  "You idolised the brave warriors of the village. You'd follow them everywhere singing and clapping and cheering for them. And just as they were waiting to ambush the great orcish force decending on your village, you sang your best and loudest. Afterwards, looking around at the horrific defeat, you took a little comfort that you gave them the send off they would have wanted.",
  "You were married early, as was the custom of your village. As with all new spouses you must traverse the wilderness to find your worth. You have a feeling it's going to be a long trip.",
  'During your teens, your friend had been injured by a bear, it was running towards you as you carried him away. "I\'ve got an idea" you screamed. You were glad the last look on your friend\'s face was the look of hope, before you dropped him and carried on running.',
  "There was a myth that surrounded your family, that you were related to the gods, and born to rule. The myth was quickly dispelled when you began to talk however, even the gods don't work THAT mysteriously.",
  "As a child you were a simple peasant, and you're proud to say you've never taken a step backward.",
  'Countless moons had passed since you left the homestead. The fact that you could only count to three seemed irrelevant.',
  "The thought of combat turned your stomach, you were a lover not a fighter. It's just you'd ended up in more fights than in love. Maybe it was the black eyes, split lip, broken nose and cauliflower ears that put people off.",
  'You didn\'t make friends easily, but you never had to have imaginary friends. You were pretty content with the "gang" that followed you around, you were obviously doing something right. Sure they were flies, but who\'s judging?',
  'You had a thirst for war, for adventure, for gold. Then you had drink, and realised it was just a thirst for water.',
  "How many times had people called you stupid? You literally had no idea. You couldn't count.",
  "The warning signs had been there, the blacksmith, your father, was dying. Maybe it was the axe in his head, maybe it was the sword sticking through his chest, but somehow you knew that time was short. You'll never forget that day you tripped over carrying the new weapons.",
  'You\'d tried to train as a paladin, but when laying on hands you were always told off for being a bit "touchy feely".',
  'You fell into your current job when talking to the village career advisor. "Warrior, now get to work", you were pretty sure she said as she handed you the pickaxe. But when you massacred the entire quarry, there seemed to be a problem, "best to take your services elsewhere", you thought.',
  "The life of an adventurer can be boring at times, you're just waiting for something to happen. At least sometimes you'd see caravans get raided and stuff. But, surely someone would sort it out at some point. Then what would you watch while you waited?",
  'Your sister was known as "a bull in a china shop", something she began to embrace. You wanted to do the same but, you were never quite sure why people told you that you were "about as much fun as a fart in a space suit". You didn\'t even know what a space suit was.',
  'You felt lost both geographically and emotionally, one day you found a road with a wooden post with directions written on a plaque nailed to it. It must have been a sign. Too many times had you witnessed injustice in the world. Too many times had you promised yourself to stop being a jerk.',
  "You left home as a child and returned an adult. Everything felt smaller, the mountain you used to climb, the house you used to live in. The welcome you got from the people who'd asked you to leave.",
