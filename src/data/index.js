  '[NAME] was raised in a barn. Since then [GENDER] has always forgotten to close doors upon entry. A problem that was highlighted at the siege of Iron Gate Castle, where as the last one to take refuge [NAME] left the famous Iron Gate wide open for the besiegers.',
  "[NAME]'s whole town was burned to the ground and [GENDER] was forced to leave to make a living on the road. Typically there was nobody left to own up to about the fire.",
  '[NAME] studied an ancient combat technique for years, becoming one of the greatest talents known in the land. Having slipped getting out the bath and landing head first, [GENDER] forgot everything... Easy come easy go.',
  "On the deathbed of [NAME]'s father, the old man produced the exquisite family sword [NAME] had desired since childhood. Before he could give his solemn speech [NAME] snatched it with a chuckle and went outside to swish it around, breaking it before the old man could breathe his dying breath.",
  "[NAME]'s mother was a fighter in the resistance. Every day she fought for [NAME]'s freedom. For [NAME]'s freedom to choose a way of life. And now [NAME] chooses to eat cereal without milk, and doesn't bother with deodorant. Life is pretty good for [GENDER2].",
  '[NAME] never amounted to much. [GENDER] never had any ambitions, never had any drive, and never had any money. What [NAME] did have was a chicken, called Kevin.',
  "[NAME]'s mother was accused of being a witch, which, in hindsight [GENDER] has always regretted.",
  '[NAME]\'s father was one of the great generals of this age. Valiant in combat, accurate in decision, apart from when [NAME] turned to him and said "pull my finger" atop that live volcano.',
  'On receiving a copper coin from the tooth fairy as a child, [NAME] continued to wobble teeth and reap the rewards. This continued into adulthood, and now [NAME] enjoys soup a lot more. ',
  "Despite running the fishery [NAME]'s father couldn't catch anything. The villagers said he couldn't even catch a cold. But as the pneumonia kicked in, it was [NAME] who had the last laugh. Actually, it was [NAME]'s father who had a last laugh.",
  '[NAME] idolised the brave warriors of the village. [GENDER] would follow them everywhere singing and clapping and cheering for them. And just as they were waiting to ambush the great orcish force descending on the village, [NAME] sang the best and loudest. Afterwards, looking around at the horrific defeat, [NAME] took a little comfort they got the send off they would have wanted.',
  "[NAME] was married early, as was the custom of the village. As with all new spouses [GENDER] must traverse the wilderness and gain combat prowess. [GENDER] has a feeling it's going to be a long trip.",
  "During [NAME]'s teens, a friend had been injured by a bear. \"I've got an idea\" screamed [NAME]. [GENDER] was glad the last look on the friend's face was the look of hope, before [NAME] dropped him and carried on running.",
  "There was a myth that surrounded [NAME]'s family, that they were related to the gods, and born to rule. The myth was quickly dispelled when [NAME] began to talk however, even the gods don't work THAT mysteriously.",
  'As a child, [NAME] was a simple peasant, and was proud to have never taken a step backward in life.',
  'Countless moons had passed since [NAME] left the homestead. The fact that [GENDER] could only count to three seemed irrelevant.',
  "The thought of combat turned [NAME]'s stomach, more of a lover than a fighter. It's just [NAME] had ended up in more fights than in love. Maybe it was the black eyes, split lip, broken nose and cauliflower ears that put people off.",
  '[NAME] didn\'t make friends easily, but [GENDER] never had to have imaginary friends. [GENDER] was pretty content with the "gang" that followed [GENDER2] everywhere. Sure they were flies, but who\'s judging?',
  '[NAME] had a thirst for war, for adventure, for gold. Then [GENDER] had a drink, and realised it was just a thirst for water.',
  "How many times had people called [NAME] stupid? [GENDER] literally had no idea. [NAME] couldn't count.",
  "The warning signs had been there, the blacksmith, [NAME]'s father, was dying. Maybe it was the axe in his head, maybe it was the sword sticking through his chest, but somehow [GENDER] knew that time was short. [NAME] wouldn't carry the weapons on roller skates again.",
  '[NAME] tried to train as a paladin, but when laying on hands was always told off for being a bit "touchy feely".',
  '[NAME] fell into employment when talking to the village career advisor. "You\'re a warrior, now get to work", [NAME] was pretty sure she said as she handed over the pickaxe. But when [GENDER] massacred the entire quarry, there seemed to be a problem. "Time to go", thought [NAME].',
  'The life of an adventurer can be boring at times,  just waiting for something to happen. At least sometimes [NAME] would see caravans get raided and stuff. But, surely someone would sort it out at some point. Then what would [NAME] watch until some work came along?',
  '[NAME]\'s sister was known as "a bull in a china shop", something she began to embrace. [NAME] wanted to do the same but, was never quite sure why people said [GENDER] was "about as much fun as a fart in a space suit". [NAME] didn\'t even know what a space suit was.',
  '[NAME] felt lost both geographically and emotionally. Finally during a long journey of soul searching, [GENDER] found a wooden post with directions written on a plaque nailed to it. It must have been a sign.',
  'Too many times had [NAME] witnessed injustice in the world. Too many times had [GENDER] promised to stop causing it.',
  "[NAME] left home as a child and returned an adult. Everything felt smaller, the mountain [GENDER] used to climb, the house [GENDER] used to live in. The welcome from the people who'd kicked [GENDER2] out in the first place.",

  "[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] on a quest for [TREASURE]. Nobody had explained that [NAME]'s party weren't friends with the dragon.",
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] reaching into a chest for [TREASURE]. Nobody can resist a button that says "don\'t push"...',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] squabbling over [TREASURE]. [NAME] tried to shoot the gas trap off-switch with a flaming arrow.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] boasting about getting [TREASURE]. [NAME] possibly read the map upside down.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] day-dreaming about [TREASURE]. [NAME] sort of mislabelled the potion bottles.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] on a quest for [TREASURE]. [NAME] waited to ambush at the wrong entrance to the dungeon.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] searching for [TREASURE]. [NAME] might have been found poking a sleeping bear.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] retrieving [TREASURE] from Orcs. [NAME] might have forgotten which side [GENDER]] was on.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] playing with [TREASURE]. [NAME] thought it would be a good idea to challenge a mind flayer to a riddle off.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] discovering [TREASURE]. [NAME] fired arrows directly up into the air in celebration of being alive.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] sneaking around the Orc sleeping quarters to find [TREASURE]. "When everyone is dead nobody can report your sneeze."',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] looking for [TREASURE] lost long ago. It might have been a bad idea to challenge the cannibals to an eating contest.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] on a get rich quick scheme for [TREASURE]. Then tested some loose stalactites for gold.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] looking in a giant basket for [TREASURE]. [NAME] may have exaggerated a snake charming ability when joining the party.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] oblivious to [TREASURE] sitting two feet away. [NAME] had forgotten to bring torches to the cavern, then lied about having darkvision.',
  "[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] distracted by [TREASURE]. [NAME] asked the genie for all the gold in the world, but didn't specify where.",
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] hoping to find the perfect gift, [TREASURE]. [NAME] failed to flirt with giant scorpion.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] eating lunch off of [TREASURE]. How was [NAME] to know trolls could regenerate?',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] diving for [TREASURE]. Suggesting the party swam in full plate had been a bad idea.',
  "[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] grabbing [TREASURE]. [NAME] didn't like the idea of the dwarf's request to toss him during a cave in.",
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] in a competition for [TREASURE]. [NAME] got a little too competitive with kills and nobody specified the party was off limits.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] removing [TREASURE] from the party leader.  [NAME] had certainly exaggerated first aid skills when joining the party.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] running away with [TREASURE]. [NAME] had cried wolf... but unfortunately it turned out to be a dragon.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] trying to lift the curse of [TREASURE]. [NAME] always been a terrible judge of character. Who knew Terry the Merciless was a bad guy?',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] jumping off a cliff to get [TREASURE]. [NAME] took the order to "fly" too literally. The "fools" bit seemed self-explanatory.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] looking to buy [TREASURE]. It was the fifth time [NAME] had given the town guard a sword pointy end first by mistake.',
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] laying on [TREASURE]. Using a Sleep scroll to get some rest was probably a bad idea.',
  "[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] retrieving [TREASURE], but didn't notice the treasure chest smiling.",
  "[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] holding off the Orcs from getting [TREASURE]. Miscounting the arrows left in the quiver didn't help.",
  "[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] digging through scrolls to find [TREASURE]. The party didn't specify what they'd like the Orc to polymorph into.",
  '[NAME] was last seen at [MAP] on a sacred quest for [TREASURE]. Someone should have mentioned the druids in the party were shapeshifters, but at least the bears were dead.',
